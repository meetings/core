Dicole TODO list
------------------

 + searching or sorting a special type column (Dropdown, Date) or
   a column that has a has_a relation to another object
   do not work as they should. For example, searching something
   that is in a dropdown-type column searches for values,
   not the actual visible content. Also, searching date-
   type columns searches through the epochs, not the
   search equivalent epoch.

 + date checking (is date valid?) should be implemented and moved
   to code from the templates to make error handling
   even possible :)

 + In Generictool::Browse, modifying default_limit_size and limit_size
   has no effect. Only way to change limit size is through set_limits
   which is stupid. Is it anyway necessary to store the limit size
   in the session? Limit start is understandable to restore the previously
   browsed page.

 * Get rid of uri_query ;) This affects many places. Form should always
   have action without parameters. Store sort, browse and search params
   in session (uri without params + page number + list number needed
   to specify different lists in wizard advanced select pages)

 * Generictool should not use views. Makes things too complicated.
   This affects sessionstore and advancedselect (at least).

 * Create common application features that utilize Generictool.

 * Content objects should have better interfaces. More content objects
   wanted for example for simple lists. They may use the old list
   templates.

 * Finish up documentation and make the documentation follow the new
   style.

 * Non-selected tools should not be usable. This requires some trick
   to check - maybe an added parameter in action.ini specifying tool?

 * Implement at least task level security for every tool.

 * Tools and securities should not use advanced select but a simple
   select. Maybe a categorized select view should be added?

 * There are some weirdless with advanced select in lists that have
   multiple pages of items.

 * When user gets removed all security information concerning that
   user should be deleted from the user security table

 * Make desktop RSS feed compatible.

 * Create a GUI for adding new group/personal tools. Allow providing
   a RSS feed.

 * Implement group deleting. Clear securities, tools, memberships etc.

 * Language selection in user manager should be generated according to
   available languages. System default language should be the default
   language in the dropdown.

 * Make this monster easier to install ;)

Dicole known bugs
-----------------

The following bugs are known to exist in the softare:

 * Renaming files with odd characters has odd results

 * File area does not ask confirmation when deleting something

 * Latest files does not show changes in file contents, only changes to
   metadata

 * Uncompressing from zip files does not create new metadata for files

 * Adding files directly to disk or through SMB shares does not add metadata
   for files

 * Copying files or performing archive operations in SMB shares does not work

 * Clicking "Tree view" tab in file area brings up the root folder, not the
