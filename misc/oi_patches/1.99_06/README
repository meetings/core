The patch modifies the following files:

lib/OpenInteract2/I18N/Initializer.pm
Fix for the Gettext implementation. Now supports the Gettext header.
Also, removes unnecessary dublicate key errors.

lib/OpenInteract2/I18N.pm
Changes the system so that instead of returning "Message error for '$key'"
it returns the key itself in cases where no translation is found.
This is to ensure that in incomplete translations the english version is
displayed instead. Previously it reported the message error.
Also moved from warn to debug the information of untranslated strings.

lib/OpenInteract2/Request.pm
Changes the order in how the language is selected:
 - prefers $lang_config->{choice_param_name} over user or session language
 - prefers user and session language over user agent provided languages
 - prefers everything else over $lang_config->{default_language}
