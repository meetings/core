------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The patch modifies the following files:

lib/OpenInteract2/Config/Initializer.pm
Just removes one very annoying log message to debug from warn.

lib/OpenInteract2/I18N/Initializer.pm
Implements the possibility to have what ever key as the message key, because
Dicole uses string based keys. It's the standard way people do translation
in the GNU Gettext world.

lib/OpenInteract2/I18N.pm
Changes the system so that instead of returning "Message error for '$key'"
it returns the key itself in cases where no translation is found.
This is to ensure that in incomplete translations the english version is
displayed instead. Previously it reported the message error.
Also moved from warn to debug the information of untranslated strings.

lib/OpenInteract2/SQLInstall.pm
Fixes the dbdata installation scheme which was broken, so that pre-inserted data
enters the database correctly upon installation.

lib/OpenInteract2/Setup.pm
Fixes the problem that Setup Globaloverride did not work.
This prevented the use of required action_override.ini and spops_override.ini,
which are used to override existing OI2 package configurations.
