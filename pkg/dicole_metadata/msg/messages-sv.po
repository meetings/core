msgid "typeset.pbltypes.desc"
msgstr "Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method that encourages students to define problems and  develop deepening understanding of the problem and its solution.<br /><br />  The basic aim of the method is to teach students to learn effectively in a group. Students start with a problem, work  cooperatively in groups to seek solutions and to develop and refine more specific problems and again work to solve them.<br /><br />  PBL enables students to think critically and analytically while searching for information from various sources. The goal is to initiate the learners curiosity on the subject at hand and to search solutions to problems as  individuals in a collaborative manner.<br /><br />  Working with the initial problem might bring new problems. The deepening problems arise from the students'  need to understand and they are often the most valued problems of the process. These problems may be solved as  part of the initial problem and are important in order to understand the solution of the initial problem.<br /><br />  When setting up problems, use more complex approach to the topic being taught. Fact-seeking questions do not always  result in advancement of understanding. New information usually emerges through solving problems in areas of incomplete  and conflicting theories."
